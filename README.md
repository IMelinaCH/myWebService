Example of a SOAP Web Service using Spring Framework

GETTING STARTED

This guide walks you through the process of creating a SOAP-based web service server with Spring.

What youâ€™ll build

You will build a server that exposes data from various European countries using a WSDL-based SOAP web service.
To simplify the example, you will use hardcoded data for the United Kingdom, Spain and Poland.
